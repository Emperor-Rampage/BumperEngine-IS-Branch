Bumper Engine TODO v1.0 
5/13/2018
Conner Lindsley

:Inital Impressions:
	-Hey, this is pretty cute. The little messages in the demo scene for new Unity users is a great touch, this is obviously geared towards easy level creation.
	-Versatile, with some pointed things missing. (Other/Customizable ways to play as different characters. They all feel almost the same.(Hard to do with only one character archtype))
	-This "Hedge Physics" or whatever is interesting, but feels un-polished in places. Going around loops, up walls, and other sudden momentum stoppers
	 feel /bad/. Losing momentum is too easy, whilst building it up takes too long/is inconsistent/requires ramps to build up.
	-!Can't build up max speed just by running! <- That's the problem. Not even spin dash puts you in max speed.
	-Not much polish, this is very much a 'Toolset. Getting visual fidelity/good uX is going to require a lot of user input.

	This is a great start and, like the debut trailer said, can be even better with the right work put in. I don't feel obligated to work on
	any of this, but why not? 

	:Goal: Help get a good set of tools out there and in the hands of people who want to play with it. 
	
	(Also, this may help me cut my teeth a bit on system/mechanics programming.)

:Design Philosophy:
	-This product needs to be able to be used by everyday people with as little learning as possible. 
	-This product needs to rely as little upon third-party packages and code as possible.
	-This product needs to be clean and pleasing to look at.

:Bugs:
	-Noticed that sometimes the character will reset their facing direction when jumping and no direction is pushed on the controller.
		Not sure what's causing it, as I haven't delved into any code.

	-Can get stuck in Spring Pads, when Homing Dashing into them. Causes the player to get stuck for a little bit before throwing them in the direction of the spring.
		Can replicate by mashing Homing Dash at a Spring. Seems to be the same throw height, despite the power of the Spring itself.
		ADDENDUM: Can throw the player in several directions, seems to be caused by homing attacking whilst standing in the spring itself. Can also
		activate when running into the Spring Pad. 
		Possible Cause: Collision detection troubles with the player and the Spring's trigger collider. Possibly add sphere collider to the Spring to remove this bug.

:UX Design Changes:
	o Screen Shake:
	o Wall Splat:
	o Postprocessing Effects for Speed:
	o Physics Tweaks: Lots of 'em.
		- Rolling degrades speed too fast. Have the character break out of the roll after a time (Expose values for customization with 0 = doesn't roll at all)
		- Let Player speed up to max speed through running.
		- Speed degrades too fast when moving Up walls, and too slow when moving horizontally.

:Feature Additions: <NOTE> These are features that would expand the scope of the toolset for other types of fan games.

	:General Engine Features:

		-Game Manager for tracking Character Progress through Levels, Stages, Hub, etc.
		-Different Character Archetypes, and systems to support them. CREATE ARCHTYPE SYSTEM FOR EASY CREATION.
			o Basic Style
				a. Type Base that has basic character functionality.
				b. No Light Speed Dash. No Drop Dash. No Bounce. White Bread.
			o Knuckles Style (Adventure)
				a. Attacks
				b. Gliding
				c. Digging
			o Tails Style (Adventure/Other)
				a. Flight (Permanent and Temporary)
			o Mech Style (Adventure)
				a. Hover
				b. Lazer Target/ Blast Targetting System (Maybe try and leverage homing attack code...)
			o Character Action Style (Unleashed/Boom?)
				a. Combo Attack System (Build upon Knux attack system? Make it one bigger Attack system?)
				b. Combo Meter
			o Boost Style (Boost Meter only?)
				a. Drifting
				b. Lane System
		     <OTHER IDEAS>
			o Shadow Style (Original-The-Character-Do-Not-Steal (Shadow the Hedgehog))
				a. Vehicle System (Hmm... Allow Mech Style characters to get in and out of the Mech?)
				b. Weapon Pickups
				c. Third Person Aiming (Allow as an option for Mech Style too? Might help with the weird "waggle" of targeting in the Adventure Mechs)
			o Team Style (Sonic Heroes)
				a. One Button Character Switch System
				b. Type Designation(Power, Speed, Flight)
			o Rider Style (Sonic Riders (lol))
				a. HOVERBOARDZ
				b. The systems for this is a whole other game (Tricks, Air Gauge, Type Hazards, Tracks and checkpoints, special interfaces, etc etc)
			o R Style (Sonic R, actual racing)
				a. Same as Rider Style, but more attainable with the toolset mechanics.
				b. A bunch of OC's racing around track with custom everything GMod style sounds kinda cool, though.
			o Other Style (Custom built Types that follow the Archtype system)
				a. This is mostly allowing people with programming knowledge to create their own.
				b. An easy way to define user made Style/Archtypes. This thing is open source so I'm not necessarily sure this is needed.

		-Easy Eqipment System (Like Adventures Ability Upgrades)
		-Grind Rails/Edges
		-(FIXED)Expanded Spline System: System is much more expansive than I originally thought. Though it seems a bit broken...
		-Parkour System (Lost World) <NOTE> I actually don't know how this works. I think it's just a /\/\/ Wall Jump, thing...
		-2D Gameplay Zones (Generations/Forces)
		-Expanded Options Menu (Kinda' a must.)
			o Graphics
			o Controls
			o Gameplay
			o Audio
		-Colorblind Mode (This will take some work, but I think it's worth it.)
		-Timer/Easy Time Tracking System
		-Health Bar 
		-Lose All or a few rings (Allow for percentages, and static values (expand to allow for static values depending on range?))
		-Extra Life
		-Monitor System
		-Stage Interactables
			o Hand Pully (Adventure)
			o Launcher (Generations, and I think, Unleashed)
			o Air Launch Pads (The QTE ones)

		-Custom Stage ending parameters
			o Choose to use the Goal Ring
			o Ending Capsule
			o Stage End Sign
			o Cutom End Volume
			o Finish Line? (Custome End Volume)
		-PreBuilt Stage End Screen for easy modification

	     <OTHER IDEAS>
		-Forces Style Character Creator (Pffffft, this thing is Open Source, just let people add in their own characters for fuck's sake)
		-Multiplayer Support
			o Local
			o Online (Local Server)
		-Enemy AI Updated to C# Jobs System and Overhauled to be more modifiable.
		-Sonic Colors/Unleashed Style Alien Powers.
		-Sonic Forces Weapon System.
		-System for changing the collectable model (Allow gems, or coins or whatever)

	:Test Game Specific Features:
		-Dialogue System

:2018.1 Updates:

	<Done> 1. Removed Rotational Particle Script (New Angular velocity component in particle system removes the need for this, though I guess I should look through it all the same.)

	<Done> 2. Need to re-copy game into 2017.3/4 to reset all the Substance Painter Materials, which I didn't know they had (But should have guessed...)

	3. Download various asset bundles: <NOTE> These are more for my useage, not the finished project as a whole. (But who cares, all of these are free anyway...)
		<Done> -Pro Builder (Man, this will likly come in SUPER handy)
		<Done> -Pro Grid (Again, level building/prototyping in general will be MUCH easier)
		<Done> -Poly Brush (Great for Terrain! I can see uses in building better terrain for gameplay)
		<Done> -Cinemachine (Cutscenes, yall)
		<Done> -Render Pipelines
			o Using the HD Pipeline, I can do some real good with the Postproccessing Stack here. Working on some DoF/Vignetting 
			  can really help with making the feeling of speed.
			o Setting up hooks for the Lightweight RP would be awesome, too.
		<Done>-Substance Painter Extension for funsies.
		-Aura for the pretties. <NOTE> Aw dammit. I didn't think about the SRP, Aura doesn't support any of the SRP features yet... And with them all in preview, I think I may be SOL for now...
		<Done>-Surge
		<Done>-Unity Chan -sd (For Testing)
		<REWORK> -Lux <Reason>  -Lux (Personal) isn't updated to 2018.1, but the paid version is. If I wanna update the Shaders for 2018.1, though...
					-Is Lux even needed now? I believe the HD RP does almost everything, internally... And I would have more control...
					-It doesn't do dynamic weather, but don't think it's necessary for the Toolset. (Would be cool, though.)
		-Possibly Aquas, Nature Starter Kit. Depends on how the HD Pipeline Messes Everything Up. In Fact...
		
	4. Import Framerate Counter and Camera Shake from Hydrus.

	5. Re-write Shaders to comply with HD and Lightweight RP. 

		- Lux Plus (the paid version) was updated to 2018.1. I figure it's only a matter of time until the personal one is as well (dood's gotta make money somehow).
		  If I can figure out exactly what these Lux shaders are used for in the Bumper Engine, build custom shaders to do whatever this needs, the project won't rely on it.
		  Unfortunatly, this has the side effect of needing upkeep by me or another programmer, because I'm certainly not getting paid for this...

		- MatCap: I'm not familiar with these shaders, but they seem to be used mainly to add faked reflections. The texture doesn't change direction from the camera,
		  and the code looks pretty light weight. Shouldn't bee too difficult to update and such... I say that, but my shader skills are still pretty weak...

		- Tri-Planar World Normal: This bitch looks great! Again, I need to run through it and figure out what's happening under the hood. This is a huge part of the level
		  creation and, as such, needs to look great in the HD RP and otherwise.

		- Having 3 versions of all the materials and shaders is going to be really annoying, so I need to keep everything clean. Speaking of clean...

	6. Clean up the File Structure and come up with a best practices guide for Code and Asset inclusion. This thing is all over the place sometimes... I can see the separation, though.
	   Just needs some polish and it'll be worth it.

	7. Find all External Dependencies in code. After the visual stuff, the actual code will need to be delved into. Going to have to remove depriciated code and comment everything, with
	   guides for anyone who comes after me.

	8. Contact the original Dev(s) and see how they're doing and talk about stuff going on.
